Hello and welcome to my repository. I thank you for your valuable time that you have put to come here. I'll make sure its worth it.

Cutting to the chase, you will find my different projects in each branch separated from this main branch.

So far, there are three projects:
1. Product Organiser: It uses spring boot for dependency injection and IoC. Connects to postgres for database using JPA repositories and is based on MVC concepts.
   
2. Hotel Reservation System: It uses JDBC to connect to postgres and performs CRUD operations on the database with its service class.



I hope you enjoy reviewing it as much as I did while bugging it.

Hope to see you on the other side.
Thank you.
